% 	Have you heard about a "Mother"? It is this thing, who will take care of you when you are [shake rate=20 level=10]weak.[/shake]
% 	- [Listen quietly]
% 	- [Tilt your head]
% 		Hm… you look unsure. That's alright. Doubt keeps us [shake rate=20 level=10]awake.[/shake]
% 	Sounds... Like a lie. A lie that I'd like to believe in.

% 	Son told us about it, he used to tell us many stories...
% 	"Mothers make lemonades! Tasty lemonades. Makes you feel like you just jumped into a cold lake on a hot day!"
% 	- [Smile faintly]
% 		Ah… you felt that, too? For a moment it’s almost real.
% 	- [Keep listening]
% 	I never understood what a "lemonade" is.
% 	Once we asked, he told us: "That's what you make when life gives you lemons!"
% 	Still have no clue what this [shake rate=20 level=10]"lemon"[/shake] is.
% 	But life doesn't seem to be interested in giving to me.
% 	So I roam around the lakeside to find some, maybe if I bring it to [shake rate=20 level=10]him[/shake], he would smile once more! And tell more stories to us!
% 	- [Nod]
% 		Yes… yes. A smile is worth a long walk.
% 	- [Look down]
% 		You understand. The shore is heavy with footsteps like ours.

% 	Sometimes, I dream about it, being one of those "Mother". If I were to be a human, I would be one of the "Mother" ones.
% 	- [Stay still]
% 	- [Offer a gentle nod]
% 	Why do I dream about that? It doesn't make sense! Why would a being sacrifice so much time for an ugly weakling? Stupid. Waste of energy.
% 	We need to make [shake rate=20 level=10]him[/shake] happy, that is what's important.
