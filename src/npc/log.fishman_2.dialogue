	    Look, I can speak! He can sing! WE DONT EVEN EAT!
	I don't understand, just don't get it. How hard I try I just, just, fuck. What is wrong with me? I should try harder.
	Show me teeth, how many do you have? I have to see!
	- [Open mouth slightly]
	    So, white, What? Why? Disgusting... I don't like it, this can't be it. Go away, GO AWAY!
	- [Keep it closed]
		Forget it! I don’t need to see. It’s probably black with tar, rotten and foul anyway...

	You blink slow, I blink fast. Which is right?
	- [Blink slowly]
	    I did practise, I do practise it. See? Blink like this—no, like this.
	Stupid neighbour says I blink too much, humans don't blink as much he says.
	The fuck does he know about humans? Ugly ass fish... Never seen one before, none of us had!
	Only the Son, he knows it, but he won't tell us anymore!
	We... Forget you know? He told us yes, but it's hard to remember.
	5 second memory he says, bullshit. I got at least 5 days of memory.
